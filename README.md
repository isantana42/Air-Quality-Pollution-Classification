# Air-Quality-and-Pollution-Classification

# Background
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model through random forest. The project aims to provide insights into which demographic features or pollutants contribute the most to air pollution, how effectively air quality categories are classified across classes, and the model's generalizability on unseen air quality conditions.  Answering these questions can help public health officials and lawmakers deliver timely advisory warnings to at-risk populations and establish effective interventions aimed at the sources of air pollution.

# Dataset Info:

**Features**
1. Temperature (°C): Average temperature of the region.
2. Humidity (%): Relative humidity recorded in the region.
3. PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³): Fine particulate matter levels.
4. PM10 Concentration (µg/m³): Coarse particulate matter levels.
5. NO2 Concentration (ppb): Nitrogen dioxide levels.
6. SO2 Concentration (ppb): Sulfur dioxide levels.
7. CO Concentration (ppm): Carbon monoxide levels.
8. Proximity to Industrial Areas (km): Distance to the nearest industrial zone.
9. Population Density (people/km²): Number of people per square kilometer in the region.


**Target Variable** - Air quality levels

- Good = Clean air with low pollution levels.

- Moderate = Acceptable air quality but with some pollutants present.

- Poor = Noticeable pollution that may cause health issues for sensitive groups.

- Hazardous = Highly polluted air posing serious health risks to the population.
